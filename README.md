# Calculating Gravity

Great Scientist Albert Einstein gave us a formula with which we can calculate the gravity of any planet. The formula is this -

Here, G is a gravitational constant, which means that it will always be the same.

M(earth) is the mass of Earth (or any other planet if we are calculating it for another planet)

d is the radius of the planet!

Here, we can see an inverse relation between the the radius of the planet and the gravity. The more the radius (and bigger the planet), the lesser would be Gravity.

But then, we also see a direct relation between The mass of the planet and the gravity. The more the mass of the planet, the more will be the gravity.

Our **Earthâ€™s gravity is 9.8 m/s**, and we as humans are accustomed to it.

In order for us to exist on any other planet, the gravity should be close to what we have here.

**Mars** has a gravity of **3.711 m/s** and **Moon** has a gravity of **1.62 m/s**.

**Calculating Gravity** : This program uses this formula to get every planet gravity , you can check the [Stars Data](./finalData.csv) .

This program will also collect all gravity of planets data into a `csv` file as `gravity.csv` .
This program is made by [Junaid](https://abujuni.dev) .

What does this program do :

- It takes `finalData.csv` (which you can call as **[Stars Data](./finalData.csv)**) .
- It finds `SI` unit of masses and radiuses of planets .
- It will take all values and finds gravity of every planet in that solar system .
- It creates a `csv` file and save as `gravity.csv`, which contains

$Gravity$ $Data$ $of$ $Every$ $Planet$ $In$ $Every$ $Solar$ $System$ $,$

$ By$ $Junaid$ $.$

## Installation

- Clone this Repo.
